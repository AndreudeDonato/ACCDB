## W4-17
### Atomization energies of 200 small molecules from Weizman (Jan Martin's group).

**Taken from:** J. Comput. Chem., 2017, 38, 2063 by Karton, Sylvetsky, and Martin. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.24854

**Notes:** All data calculated with different flavors of the very reliable W4 composite method.

**Not from Martin's group (developed by TCC@FIT):**
