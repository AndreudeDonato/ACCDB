### Valence and Rydberg excitations for p-block elements (2p, 3p, 4p).

**Taken from:** J. Chem. Phys., 2011, 135, 044118 by Yang, Peverati, Truhlar and Valero. https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3607312?journalCode=jcp

**Notes:** In valence excitations, an electron is excited from an ns orbital to an np orbital. In Rydberg excitations, an electron is excited from a np orbital to a (n+1)s orbital. Reference energies are experimental energies taken from C. E. Moore, Atomic Energy Levels, Vol. Iâ€“II, Circular of the National Bureau of Standards 467, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC (1949). Spin-orbit energies and relativistic effects are excluded.

**Subsets:**
- V9: Valence excitations.
  - V4: Significant Subset of Valence excitations: B, Al+, Si+, and Ga.
- R8: Rydberg excitations.
  - R4: Significant Subset of Rydberg excitations: Ne, Cl, Ar, Br.
