## 3d-SSIP30
### Spin States and Ionization Potentials for first-row (3d) transition metals (30 data: 20SS + 10IP)

**Taken from:** J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2014, 10, 102, by Luo, Averkiev, Yang, Xu  and Truhlar. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct400712k

**Notes:** Spin States refers to the lowest-energy multiplicity-changing excitation energy for each species. Reference energies are experimental energies taken from Moore, C. E. Atomic Energy Levels; National Bureau of Standards (Washington, DC, 1949−1958, Vols. 1−3), with spin-orbit coupling removed.

**Subsets:** 
- SS20 Spin States of 10 atoms and 10 cations
- IP10 Ionization Potentials of 10 atoms
