## 4d-SSIP24
### Spin States and Ionization Potentials for second-row (4d) transition metals (24 data: 16SS + 8IP)

**Taken from:** J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2012, 8, 4112, by Luo and Truhlar. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct300737t

**Notes:** Spin States refers to the lowest-energy multiplicity-changing excitation energy for each species. Reference energies are experimental energies taken from Moore, C. E. Atomic Energy Levels; National Bureau of Standards (Washington, DC, 1949−1958, Vols. 1−3), with spin-orbit coupling removed.

**Subsets:**
- SS16 Spin states of 8 atoms and 8 cations.
- IP8 Ionization potentials of 8 atoms.
