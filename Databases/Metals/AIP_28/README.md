### Ionization Potentials of 28 Actinides monoxides and dioxides (from Th to Cm).

**Taken from:** Theor. Chem. Acc., 2011, 129, 657, by Averkiev, Mantina, Valero, Infante, Kovacs, Truhlar, and Gagliardi. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00214-011-0913-0
 
**Notes:** The experimental data reported have all an uncertainty of 0.2 eV (the only exceptions being ThO and UO, for which an uncertainty of 0.8 meV and 0.6 meV is reported) for the first IPs, and an uncertainty of more than 0.6 eV on average for the second IPs.
Therefore, we decided to adopt the CASPT2 results as reference data: they agree well with the experiment, and they have the lowest MUEs among the methods used in the article (CCSD, CCSD(T), and various DFs).
All data reported are calculated at the CASPT2/ANO-RCC (triple zeta quality) level.
The active space used in this work is written as CAS(orbitals,electrons): CAS(16,14) has been used for the monoxides (14 orbitals for the metals, 2 for oxygen), and CAS(14,14) for the dioxide species.
We reported (and adopt) CASPT2 geometries as reference geometries for all the AnOx (An = actinides, x=1,2). 
All reference data are electronic energies, and therefore they don't include neither spin-orbit coupling, nor ZPEs.
