**Notes:** The reference energies are calculated at the CASPT2 level of theory. For structures labelled PorSS11, the iron porphyrin structure is optimized at the PBE0/def2-TZVP, all other structures are optimized at the BP86/def2-TZVP level. For structures labelled PorBE10, the iron porphyrin and the biatomic gases are optimized at the PBE0/def2-TZVP level, all other structures are optimized at the BP86/def2-TZVP level. 

**Subsets:**
- PorSS11 Spin states of 3 Mn porphyrins, 1 Co porphyrin, and 7 Fe porphyrins.
- PorBE10 Bond energies for iron porphyrin and iron porphyrin imidazole with N2, O2, and CO.
